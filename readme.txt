I used the following JavaScript libraries: Jest, Allure, Config, Selenium WebDriver, ChromeDriver;
Best practices: 
- Page object pattern;
- Used jest to run and describe tests and features, so it is much clear for users
- Added allure report
- Possible to extend test framework with other browsers
- Used classes in JS to make code a bit clear and extendable
- Added config to run tests on few environments

To run tests in console/terminal or gitBash (if git is installed) run following scripts from root folder:
- npm install 
- npm run test-chrome
- npm run report 

Note: used chromedriver 83 version, so it should be run on Chrome version 83
